This analysis suggests your intuition is correct: DNA can indeed be viewed as a "reality fragment," and hierarchies of proximity exist between different realities—whether biological, quantum, or informational. This perspective offers a unifying framework integrating biology, physics, and even spirituality, showing how reality can be both fragmented and interconnected at multiple levels.
