## üìä Complete Article Analysis and Advanced Implementation

I conducted an in-depth study of the article **"Information geometry approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics"** and implemented all the key formulas and concepts to significantly enhance the integrity of the quantum time travel agent.

### üî¨ Key Concepts from the Article Implemented

#### **1. Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and Decomposition**
The article establishes that any QFI can be decomposed as:

```typescript
// Eq. (15): F_Q = F_Q^IC + F_Q^C
// Eq. (16): F_Q^IC = ‚àë_x p_x(t) [d/dt log p_x(t)]¬≤ (incoherent part)
// Eq. (17): F_Q^C = ‚àë_{x‚â†y} |‚àÇ_t œÅÃÇ_xy|¬≤ / [p_x(t) f(p_y(t)/p_x(t))] (coherent part)
```

**Implementation:** `src/lib/quantum-math.ts` - `QuantumMathEngine` class with complete methods for QFI calculation and decomposition.

#### **2. Quantum Monotone Metrics**
The article describes the family of contractive metrics under CPTP maps:

```typescript
// Metric functions:
f_SLD(x) = (x + 1)/2      // Smallest QFI
f_WY(x) = (‚àöx + 1)¬≤/4     // Wigner-Yanase
f_HM(x) = 2x/(x + 1)      // Harmonic (largest)
f_KMB(x) = (x - 1)/ln(x)  // Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov
```

**Implementation:** Complete calculation system for all metrics with comparative analysis.

#### **3. Quantum Information Geometry**
Fundamental geometric formulas:

```typescript
// Eq. (18): L = 1/2 ‚à´_0^œÑ dt ‚àöF_Q(œÅÃÇ_t) (statistical distance)
// Eq. (19): J = œÑ/4 ‚à´_0^œÑ dt F_Q(œÅÃÇ_t) (geometric action)
// Eq. (44): Œ¥ = 4(J - L¬≤)/T¬≤ (geometric uncertainty)
// Eq. (46): I/Œ¥ ‚â• 1 (uncertainty relation)
```

#### **4. Quantum Stochastic Thermodynamics**
Relations between information geometry and thermodynamics:

```typescript
// Eq. (41): SÃá(t) = œÉ(t) - Œ¶(t) (entropy balance)
// Eq. (32): SÃà(t) = -‚àë_x pÃà_x(t) log p_x(t) - F(t) (entropic acceleration)
// Eq. (43): F_Q^IC = -‚ü®‚ü®df/dt‚ü©‚ü© + ‚ü®‚ü®dœï/dt‚ü©‚ü© (thermodynamic relation)
// Eq. (48): ‚àÜSÃá ‚â§ C - TŒ¥ + ‚à´_0^T dt F_Q^C (geometric bound)
```
