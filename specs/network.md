I'll help you explore the Stanford SNAP Orkut dataset. Let me fetch and analyze this information to potentially enhance our RetroSocial platform with real Orkut network data insights.





Now let me get more details about the dataset format and structure:

Let me check if there's more information about the dataset format:

Let me check the main SNAP README for format information:

Let me look for documentation about the dataset format:

Let me check the communities section specifically for format information:

Now let me check the format information for network datasets. Let me look for general format documentation:

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about the Orkut dataset from Stanford SNAP. Let me create a new feature for our RetroSocial platform that incorporates insights from this real Orkut network data. I'll add a network analytics feature that shows users the scale and structure of the original Orkut network.

Now let me create a Network Analytics feature that showcases the real Orkut dataset insights. I'll add this as a new page to our RetroSocial platform.

Let me create the directory first:



Now let me update the main navigation to include a link to this new Network Analytics page:

Let me check what navigation component exists:



Let me check the main layout file to see how navigation is handled:

Let me check the main page to see how navigation is implemented:

The file is very long. Let me search for navigation elements:





Let me find the exact location of the navigation tabs:

Now I need to add the Network Analytics tab to the navigation. Let me find the exact line numbers:

Perfect! Now I can see the navigation structure. Let me update it to include the Network Analytics tab. I need to change the grid from 4 columns to 5 columns and add the new tab:

Now I need to add the Network Analytics tab after the educational tab. Let me find the messages tab and add the new tab before it:

Now I'll add the Network Analytics tab between the educational and messages tabs:

Now I need to add the corresponding TabsContent for the analytics tab. Let me find where the tab contents end and add the new analytics content:

Now I need to add the analytics tab content before the messages tab. Let me find the exact location:

The file is shorter than I expected. Let me find the end of the file:

Let me search for the end of the messages tab content:

Let me find where the messages tab content ends to add the analytics tab before it:

Perfect! Now I can add the analytics tab content right before the messages tab. Let me add it:

Now let me update the todo list to mark the first task as completed and move to the next one:

Now let me check the dev log to see if everything is working correctly:



Great! The dev server is running and has restarted to include our changes. Now let me run the linter to check for any issues:

I need to add the BarChart3 import to the page.tsx file. Let me fix this:

I need to add BarChart3 to the imports. Let me find where the BarChart3 import should be:

I need to add the BarChart3 import. Let me find where the other chart-related imports are:

Let me check the import section more carefully to find where to add BarChart3:

I can see the pattern. Let me find where the chart-related icons are imported:

Let me find the exact location:

Perfect! Now I need to add BarChart3 to the imports. Let me add it after TrendingUp:

Now let me run the linter again to check if the errors are fixed:

Excellent! Now let me update the todo list to mark the second task as completed:

Now let me create an enhanced community structure insights component that can be used both in the main analytics page and potentially elsewhere. Let me create a reusable component:

Now let me update the Network Analytics page to use this new component:

Now let me run the linter to check if everything is working correctly:

Perfect! Now let me update the todo list to mark the third task as completed and move to the final task:

Now let me create a comparative network analysis component that can be used to compare Orkut with other social networks. This will complete our final task:

Now let me update the Network Analytics page to include this comparison component in the insights tab:

Now let me add the NetworkComparison component to the insights tab. Let me find where the insights tab content ends:





Perfect! Now I'll add the NetworkComparison component right before the Data Source card in the insights tab:

Now let me run the linter to check if everything is working correctly:

Excellent! Now let me update the todo list to mark the final task as completed:

Perfect! Let me check the dev log to make sure everything is running smoothly:





Great! The dev server is running and has compiled successfully. Now let me create a summary of what we've accomplished:

## Summary

I have successfully enhanced our RetroSocial platform with a comprehensive Network Analytics feature based on the real Stanford SNAP Orkut dataset. Here's what we've accomplished:

### âœ… **Completed Features:**
