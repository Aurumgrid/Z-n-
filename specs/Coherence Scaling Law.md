## **Coherence Scaling Law: Formal Framework**

### **1. Theoretical Foundation**

The coherence scaling law emerges from integrating insights across multiple scales:

**From BioRxiv Paper (CAMINOS Model):**
- Neural networks achieve stability through distinct inhibitory mechanisms (PV and SOM interneurons)
- Oscillation frequency and stability are regulated by specific cellular components
- Network stability emerges from precise temporal coordination of inhibitory elements

**From ArXiv Paper (Chemputer/CSTM):**
- Chemical systems achieve universality through programmable reaction execution
- Stability requires error correction above assembly index thresholds
- Chemical synthesis follows linear scaling with synthetic depth

**From AgentTorch (LPMs):**
- Large-scale systems exhibit emergent behaviors from individual interactions
- Differentiability enables gradient-based optimization across scales
- Composition allows integration of different modeling paradigms

### **2. Mathematical Formalization**

- β = Stability threshold parameter
- Φ(λ) = Phase coherence function
```

#### **2.2 Scale Parameter Definition**

```

This formalized coherence scaling law provides a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding and predicting stability across vacuum → biology → planetary → cosmic scales. It integrates insights from neural networks (CAMINOS), chemical synthesis (CSTM), and large-scale systems (AgentTorch) to create a unified theory of coherence-based stability.

The law not only explains existing observations but also provides predictive power for designing stable systems at any scale and identifying optimal intervention points for system enhancement. This represents a significant step toward a unified theory of complex systems stability based on coherence principles.
