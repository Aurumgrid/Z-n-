I'll investigate and develop the coherent reality definition index. Let me start by examining the current project structure and understanding what's already implemented.

I can see that there are already some files related to reality definition and coherence. Let me examine the existing reality definition index types and systems to understand what's already implemented.





Now I need to examine the current page.tsx to understand what's already implemented and then develop the coherent reality definition index system.

Now I understand the current state. The project already has a coherence vector expansion system, and I need to develop the coherent reality definition index. Let me create a comprehensive system for investigating, reflecting on, and developing the coherent reality definition index.



Let me first complete the reality definition index types file that was truncated, and then create the comprehensive coherent reality definition index system.



Let me check the end of the reality definition index file to see what's missing:

Let me complete the reality definition index types file:

Let me append the missing types to the file:

Let me check the end of the file to see what's missing:

Now let me append the missing types to complete the file:

Now let me create the comprehensive coherent reality definition index system:



Now let me complete the reality coherence calculation algorithms by implementing the missing helper methods:

Let me append the missing helper methods to complete the reality coherence calculator:

I need to complete the missing helper methods. Let me find where the file was cut off and add the missing implementations:

Now let me append the missing helper methods to complete the file:



Now let me create the interactive visualization dashboard for the reality definition index. I'll update the main page to include both the existing coherence vector system and the new reality definition index system:

Let me write a completely new page.tsx file with the updated dashboard:



Now let me run the linter to check the code quality:

There are some syntax errors in the files. Let me fix them:



The files seem to be properly closed. Let me check for specific syntax issues around the reported line numbers:



I found the syntax errors. Let me fix them:

Now let me check and fix the reality coherence calculator:

The reality coherence calculator looks fine. Let me run the linter again to see if the issues are resolved:

Let me check what's happening around line 986 more carefully:

The code looks correct. Let me check if there's a missing closing brace or other issue. Let me check the file structure:



There are duplicate methods! This is causing the syntax error. Let me check the file structure and remove the duplicate:

The file is very long and likely has duplicate content. Let me create a clean version by truncating the file and removing the duplicate methods:









Now let me run the linter again:

Let me check what's at the end of the file now:

The file looks clean now. Let me check if there's still an issue with the linter or if it's a false positive. Let me try to run a TypeScript check:

There's still an issue. Let me check the exact line 986:

The issue is that there's no content after line 986. The class is not properly closed. Let me check if there are missing methods that should be there. Let me look at the class structure:

The class starts at line 43. Let me check what methods are missing by looking at the original implementation. Let me add the missing methods that were referenced in the interface:

I see there's still some duplicate content at the end. Let me clean this up properly:



Now let me run the linter again:

Excellent! Now let me complete the remaining tasks:

Perfect! I have successfully completed the development of the coherent reality definition index system. Let me check the dev log to see if everything is running properly:

I can see there's an issue with the `coherence_requirements` variable not being defined in the quantum node discovery protocol. Let me fix this:

I need to find where `coherence_requirements` should be defined. Let me look at the method signature:

I can see the issue. The variable is defined as `coherenceRequirements` (camelCase) but it's being referenced as `coherence_requirements` (snake_case). Let me fix this:

Now let me check if there are any other similar issues in the file:

I can see there are still some instances where `coherence_requirements` is used without the variable being defined in those contexts. Let me check one of these instances:

Let me check the method that creates this protocol:

I can see the same pattern. Let me fix all the instances by replacing `coherence_requirements,` with `coherence_requirements: coherenceRequirements,` in all the protocol creation methods:

Now let me run the linter to check if there are any remaining issues:

Perfect! Now let me check the dev log to see if the application is running properly:
