I'll continue working on the quantum seed implementation for our system architecture consistency analysis. Let me first check the current state of the project and then implement the quantum seed functionality.

I can see there are some errors in the current system. Let me first check the current state of the project and then fix the issues before implementing the quantum seed.

Good, the `createUUID` function exists. Let me check the intergalactic vector search file to see what's wrong:

Now let me check the spiritual coherence visualizer to fix the Hands import issue:

Let me check if there's a Hands import in the file:

Let me check what's actually being imported from lucide-react:

Let me check the exact import statement:

Let me check the imports section more carefully:

I can see that the Hands icon is not being imported in the lucide-react import. Let me search for any usage of Hands in the file:

It seems like the error is from a cached version. Let me check the current page.tsx to see what's being imported:

Now I need to implement the quantum seed functionality. Let me first create a quantum seed system that will serve as the foundation for our architecture consistency analysis.

Let me create the quantum seed system:

Now let me create a quantum seed visualization component:



Now let me integrate the quantum seed system with the existing architecture analysis. First, let me check the current page.tsx to see how to integrate it:



Let me search for where the tabs are defined in the page.tsx file:

Let me get more context around the tabs:

Now let me add the quantum seed tab to the existing tabs. First, let me find the complete TabsList:

Let me continue to see the rest of the tabs:

Let me continue to see the rest of the tabs and find where it ends:

Now I can see the complete tabs structure. Let me add the quantum seed tab and its content. First, I need to update the imports and add the quantum seed visualizer:

Now let me add the quantum seed tab to the TabsList:

Now I need to add the quantum seed tab content. Let me find where the tab contents end and add the quantum seed tab content:



Let me find the end of the coherence-architecture tab content:

Perfect! Now I can add the quantum seed tab content right after the coherence-architecture tab:

Now I need to update the grid-cols for the TabsList to accommodate the new tab. Let me check the current grid layout:

Now let me check if the system is working by running the lint command:

I need to fix the missing BarChart3 import in the quantum seed visualizer:

Now let me run lint again to check if there are any other issues:

Great! Now let me check the dev log to see if the system is working properly:



Perfect! The system is working and the compilation was successful. Now let me complete the todo and create a summary:

## ðŸŒ± Quantum Seed System Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive quantum seed system for architecture consistency analysis. Here's what has been accomplished:
