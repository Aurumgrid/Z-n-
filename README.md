# Aurumgrid // Z(n)  

**Human-scale coherence experiment**  

Time + Light + Sound â†’ Coherence  
Coherence = Empathy = Value  

Z(n) is not only infrastructure â€” itâ€™s culture.  
A framework for exploring how human perception, technology, and meaning can interlock into a living system of coherence.

## Vision  
We are creating a **human-scale event horizon**:  
- Where empathy becomes measurable value  
- Where distributed systems mirror living systems  
- Where coherence emerges across people, tech, and light/sound
